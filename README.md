## OpenCV Face Detection Application
This is a simple OpenCV application to detect faces in an image. The application uses Haar cascade classifier XML file to perform face detection.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV 4.x

## How to run the application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

````
git clone https://github.com/<repository_name>.git
````

2. Navigate to the project directory using the command:
````
cd <repository_name>
````
3. Install the required packages using the command:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
4. Run the application using the command:
````
python main.py
````
5. The application will detect faces in the sample image image.jpg. The output image will be saved in the project directory with the name output.jpg.


## How to use with a different image
